# GitHub Basics Exercise

### Part I

Let's start by taking a bit of time to practice the git workflow below. It is so valuable to just practice this workflow a couple times, since you will most likely doing it professionally as well as in your individual projects and open source contributions. Here are some things to do.

1. Create a local repository and add and commit some files
2. Create a remote repository and push your code from the local repo to the remote
3. Fork the repo [https://github.com/rithmschool/git_practice](https://github.com/rithmschool/git_practice) - clone it and submit a pull request
4. Create a new branch locally and push it to GitHub
5. Submit a pull request with your new branch against the `master` branch on the `git_practice` repo.
