# Git Basics Exercise

Now that you have learned the basics of Git workflow, try running through this a couple of times on your own:

1. Create a folder called `learn_git_again`.
2. `cd` into the `learn_git_again` folder.
3. Create a file called `third.txt`. 
4. Initialize an empty git repository. 
5. Add `third.txt` to the staging area.
6. Commit with the message "adding third.txt".
7. Check out your commit with `git log`.
8. Create another file called `fourth.txt`.
9. Add `fourth.txt` to the staging area.
10. Commit with the message "adding fourth.txt"
11. Remove the `third.txt` file
12. Add this change to the staging area
13. Commit with the message "removing third.txt"
14. Check out your commits using `git log`
15. Change your global setting to `core.pager=cat` - you can read more about that [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration). 
16. Write the command to list all of the global configurations for `git` on your machine. You can type `git config --global` to find out how to do this
